<p>Is an open source project aiming to provide a framework for the management 
    of bare metal structure as a Kubernetes application.Its designed 
    in a way to easily manage the structure and deployment of bare metals.</p>
    <br>
    <p> It provides components that allows the user to to do metal host management 
        for kubernetes and work as a kubernetes application,that means it runs on kubernetes and 
        is managed by kubernetes interfaces.This is a sandbox project of the Cloud Native
         Computing Foundation which supports and provides direction to cloud native projects.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The platform also includes a number of other tools and components, 
        including Metal3-io/Cluster-API-Provisioner-Metal, which allows 
        Metal3 to integrate with Kubernetes' Cluster API.

        Overall, Metal3 aims to make it easier for users to deploy and manage bare metal 
        infrastructure, while also providing a level of abstraction that allows them 
        to treat bare metal nodes in the same way as cloud instances or virtual machines.</p>
